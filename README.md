## Description

This package provides Python Virtualenv support for Atom users.

## Requirements

This package **works in UNIX and WINDOWS systems** :)

This package currently supports:

* A [virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper) installation
* Projects in your $HOME folder with virtualenvs inside it
* Environments in the root folder of you projects (ex: project1/env or project1/venv), so you can add the project paths manually in the additional virtual envs settings

## Usage

By default this plug-in is configured to use with a virtualenvwrapper and to get virtualenvs from the $HOME folder. But you can add specific virtualenvs paths too.
